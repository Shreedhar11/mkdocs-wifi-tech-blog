# Evolution of MIMO in Wi-Fi Standards

**MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output)** technology has been a cornerstone of Wi-Fi evolution since 2009. It evolved from boosting single-user throughput to efficiently serving dense, multi-user environments. By using multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver, MIMO improves signal reliability, spectral efficiency, and overall data throughput.

## Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n – 2009): Introduction of SU-MIMO

- Introduced **Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO)**, enabling devices to transmit and receive multiple data streams simultaneously.
- Supported up to **4×4 configurations** (4 transmit × 4 receive antennas).
- Achieved data rates up to **600 Mbps**, making Wi-Fi a viable alternative to wired networking.

## Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac Wave 2 – 2013/2015): Introduction of MU-MIMO

- Introduced **Downlink Multi-User MIMO (DL MU-MIMO)**, allowing an access point to transmit to multiple clients at the same time.
- Supported **4×4**, with later implementations extending to **8×8** antenna configurations.
- Operated **exclusively in the 5 GHz band**.
- Commonly paired with **beamforming** to improve signal directionality and efficiency in congested environments.

## Wi-Fi 6 & 6E (802.11ax – 2019/2020): Bidirectional Efficiency

- Added **Uplink MU-MIMO**, enabling multiple clients to transmit simultaneously.
- Increased spatial stream support up to **8×8**.
- Significantly improved performance in **high-density environments** such as offices, campuses, and public venues.
- Supported operation in:
  - **2.4 GHz**
  - **5 GHz**
  - **6 GHz** (Wi-Fi 6E extension)

## Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be – 2024+): Enhanced Capacity and Speed

- Expands MIMO support up to **16×16 spatial streams**.
- Introduces enhanced **MU-MIMO** and **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)** for higher throughput and better reliability.
- Supports **320 MHz channels** and advanced **coordinated beamforming**.
- Enables peak theoretical speeds of up to **40 Gbps**.
